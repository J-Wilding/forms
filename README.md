# Intentional Synchronous Division of Attention Study (ISDAS)

[Check it out](https://isdas.jonathanwilding.com)

This site is designed to test whether intentional multi-tasking has improved performance/more retention compared with spontaneous multi-tasking. 

## Experiment Design

This test is to work in conjunction with Weinan's site which provides a base spontaneous multi-tasking data, i.e. examines the effect of retention and performance given interruptions. Participants will then be directed to this site to collect data given similar tasks with equal weight, with the goal of performing both at the same time to the best of their ability.
